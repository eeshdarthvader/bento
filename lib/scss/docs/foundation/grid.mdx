# Grid

The grid system helps maintain a horizontal rhythm to the page. All major layout-ing elements should line up to the columns.


## Grid container

The container constrains the grid system to a max width of `1140px`. On smaller screen sizes the container shrinks to take up the available space on screens. More on this later.


## Grid sizes

The grid composes 24 columns of `32px` each with gutters of `16px`. All borders and paddings are included within the widths, since `border-box` is applied on the grid.

## Mixed grids

The grid layout can be easily extended by mixing different column sizes. It is also possible to nests columns within a single column.

## Offset

Its possible to leave a few columns "blank". Its not necessary to use all available columns when considering a layout.

You chose to leave a gap of a few columns between elements.


## Example layouts

In the example below is a multi column layout centered on the page,while leaving a gap of `2 col` on either side.

<div className="mt-40" />

This layout is an example of a 3 col layout with each section taking up different numer of columns.
